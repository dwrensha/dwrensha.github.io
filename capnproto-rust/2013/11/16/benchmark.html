<p>Below I describe the results of a
performance comparison between
<a href="https://www.github.com/dwrensha/capnproto-rust">capnproto-rust</a>
and the definitive
<a href="https://www.github.com/kentonv/capnproto">C++ implementation</a>.</p>

<p>To perform the comparison,
I reimplemented in Rust the three benchmark cases
included with capnproto-c++.
Each case consists of some communications
between a client and a server,
with
nontrivial computation taking place at both ends.</p>

<p>Within each case,
there are five possible modes of communication.
The simplest is “object”, in which the sender
directly passes an in-memory object.
In “bytes”, the sender writes
its message to a byte buffer, which
it then passes directly.
In “pipe”, the sender writes
its message as bytes over a pipe
to another process.
In the “packed” versions of “bytes” and “pipe”,
the sender applies Cap’n Proto standard packing
to the raw bytes before sending.</p>

<p>The “carsales” case emphasizes
records with many numeric fields.
For each communication mode,
I ran 10000 iterations,
resulting in a
throughput of about 125 MB unpacked, or 81 MB packed.</p>

<p>Here capnproto-rust is roughly even with capnproto-c++
except for the cases where it has to do I/O, in which case
relative performance degrades slightly.</p>

<p>The “catrank” emphasizes string processing.
I ran 1000 iterations for each mode, resulting in a
throughput of about 206 MB unpacked, or 186 MB packed.</p>

<p>Here capnproto-rust’s relative performance is fairly consistent,
and a bit worse than in the “carsales” case. I believe
the main reason for this is that capnproto-rust is doing extra string
copies to get around the fact that I have not yet implemented direct
writing for string fields.</p>

<p>The “eval” case emphasizes nested structures.
I ran 200000 iterations for each mode,
resulting in a throughput of about 262 MB unpacked,
or 80 MB packed.</p>

<p><img src="/capnproto-rust/assets/eval.png" width="500" /></p>

<p>Here we see capnproto-rust’s relative performance degrade
significantly when it must perform I/O.
I am uncertain why this degradation occurs,
though it seems to be related to the size of the messages.
Unpacked, the total size of a
single “eval” request plus a single “eval” response
is about 1 KB,
compared to the averages
of about 12 KB in the “carsales” case
and about 200 KB in the “catrank” case.</p>
