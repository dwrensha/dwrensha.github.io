<p>The concurrency story of
<a href="https://crates.io/crates/capnp-rpc">capnp-rpc-rust</a>
gets a major update in today’s version 0.8 release.
Previously, the remote procedure call system was built
on top of <a href="https://github.com/dwrensha/gj">GJ</a>,
an event loop framework designed specifically for Cap’n Proto,
described in some of my <a href="/capnproto-rust/2015/05/25/asynchronous-io-with-promises.html">previous</a>
<a href="/capnproto-rust/2016/01/11/async-rpc.html">posts</a>.
The new version drops GJ in favor of
<a href="https://github.com/alexcrichton/futures-rs">futures-rs</a>,
a library that is quickly becoming the standard
foundation for asynchronous programming in Rust.</p>

<p>At the level of types, the update is fairly
straightforward.
The main asynchronous building block in GJ is the struct
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Promise&lt;T, E&gt;</code>, representing a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> that might not
be ready yet. To migrate to futures-rs, each <code class="highlighter-rouge">gj::Promise&lt;T,E&gt;</code> can be translated into
a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Box&lt;futures::Future&lt;Item=T,Error=E&gt;&gt;</code>,
and the high-level structure of a program usually does not need to change.</p>

<p>Many nice properties derive from the fact that <code class="highlighter-rouge">Future</code> is a <em>trait</em>, not a struct,
and does not need to be put in a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Box</code>.
Concrete types implementing <code class="highlighter-rouge">Future</code> can be used in generics,
making it possible for combinators like <code class="highlighter-rouge">.then()</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">.join()</code>
to avoid heap allocations
and to avoid losing type information.
In particular, the typechecker can know at compile time
whether it is safe to send a future between threads!</p>

<p>The Rust community has a growing ecosystem of libraries based on
futures-rs, and today’s capnp-rpc-rust release
should work well with all of them.
For example, a Cap’n Proto method could invoke
<a href="https://crates.io/crates/futures-cpupool">futures-cpupool</a>
to distribute computation-heavy work among a pool of worker threads,
or it could use one of the emerging asynchronous database drivers
to make queries on a remote database, or it could do,
well, anything that can be expressed in terms of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Future</code> trait.
As a quick demonstration, I have implemented a
simple <a href="https://github.com/dwrensha/capnp-rpc-rust/tree/master/examples/http-requests">example</a>
that uses <a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio-curl">tokio-curl</a>
to make asynchronous HTTP requests.</p>

<p>There are many exciting possibilities to explore.
If any of this sounds interesting to you, I encourage you to get involved!
