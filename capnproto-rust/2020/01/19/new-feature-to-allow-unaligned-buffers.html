<p><a href="/2020/01/11/unaligned-memory-access.html">Last week</a> I wrote about
how capnproto-rust might relax its memory alignment requirements
and what the performance cost of that might look like.
The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/en9fmn/should_capnprotorust_force_users_to_worry_about/">ensuing discussion</a>
taught me that memory alignment issues can be thornier than I had thought,
and it strengthened my belief that capnproto-rust users ought be shielded
from such issues. Since then, working with the helpful feedback
of many people, I have implemented what I consider to be a satisfactory resolution to the problem.
Today I’m releasing it as part of capnproto-rust version 0.12.
The new version not only provides a safe interface for unaligned memory, but also maintains high performance
for aligned memory.</p>

<h2 id="new-feature-flag">New Feature Flag</h2>
<p>Cargo supports a
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-features-section">feature-flags</a>
mechanism, whereby a crate can declare parts of its functionality to be optional, with enablement or disablement
happening at compile time.</p>

<p>As of version 0.12, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">capnp</code> crate has a new
<a href="https://github.com/capnproto/capnproto-rust/blob/9fa83b89eebb10aba6a1181bb7e4f9a4fad916f6/capnp/Cargo.toml#L30-L32">feature flag called <code class="highlighter-rouge">unaligned</code></a>.
When <code class="highlighter-rouge">unaligned</code> is enabled, <code class="highlighter-rouge">capnp</code> makes no assumptions about the alignment of its data.
In particular, it can read a message in place from any array of bytes via
<a href="https://github.com/capnproto/capnproto-rust/blob/9fa83b89eebb10aba6a1181bb7e4f9a4fad916f6/capnp/src/serialize.rs#L57-L65"><code class="highlighter-rouge">read_message_from_flat_slice()</code></a>.</p>

<p>On the flip side, when <code class="highlighter-rouge">unaligned</code> is <em>not</em> enabled, <code class="highlighter-rouge">capnp</code> requires that message segments are 8-byte aligned,
<a href="https://github.com/capnproto/capnproto-rust/blob/9fa83b89eebb10aba6a1181bb7e4f9a4fad916f6/capnp/src/private/arena.rs#L92-L100">returning an error</a>
if it detects that’s not the case.
The 8-byte alignment is then used whenever
<code class="highlighter-rouge">capnp</code> loads or stores a primitive value in a message.</p>

<p>With the new interface, there is no longer a need for the problematic <code class="highlighter-rouge">unsafe fn Word::bytes_to_words()</code>,
so that method no longer exists.</p>

<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>

<p>The downside of enabling the <code class="highlighter-rouge">unaligned</code> feature is that some operations require
more instructions on certain compilation targets.
To better understand the performance cost,
I ran capnproto-rust’s
<a href="https://github.com/capnproto/capnproto-rust/tree/9fa83b89eebb10aba6a1181bb7e4f9a4fad916f6/benchmark">benchmark suite</a>
on three different computers: my laptop (x86_64), an EC2 ARM64 instance (aarch64), and a Raspberry Pi Zero (armv6).
I compared three different capnproto-rust versions: 0.11, 0.12, and 0.12 with <code class="highlighter-rouge">unaligned</code>.</p>

<p>As expected, on all of the computers
the 0.12 version without the <code class="highlighter-rouge">unaligned</code> feature performed about the same version 0.11
(within measurement noise).
When I enabled the <code class="highlighter-rouge">unaligned</code> feature, the only computer where there
was a noticeable performance impact was the Raspberry Pi,
where the benchmarks slowed down between 10 and 20 percent.
This also was within my expectations, though I had been hoping
it would be lower. (If the performance impact had been negligible,
I would likely not have bothered to make <code class="highlighter-rouge">unaligned</code> an optional feature; instead
I would have made it the <em>only</em> supported mode.)</p>

<h2 id="validation">Validation</h2>

<p>Following <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/en9fmn/should_capnprotorust_force_users_to_worry_about/fedr67j/">ralfj’s suggestion</a>,
I also performed some testing with <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri">miri</a>
to increase my confidence that there is no lurking undefined behavior.
I added <a href="https://github.com/capnproto/capnproto-rust/blob/9fa83b89eebb10aba6a1181bb7e4f9a4fad916f6/capnp/src/private/layout_test.rs#L24">some tests</a>
that specifically force 1-byte alignment.</p>

<p>I was pleasantly surprised to learn how easy it is to run miri these days:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ rustup component add miri
$ cargo miri test
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>I recommend that you try this on your own projects!</p>
